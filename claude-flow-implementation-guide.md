- **Optimized Memory Storage**: More efficient memory storage and retrieval
- **Enhanced Memory Coordination**: Better coordination through shared memory

## Using the Most Robust Coordination Features

### 1. Parallel Execution Pattern

The most critical pattern for effective use of Claude-Flow is the parallel execution pattern:

```javascript
// CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  // MCP coordination setup
  mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { topology: "mesh", maxAgents: 6 }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "researcher" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "analyst" }
  
  // Claude Code execution - ALL in parallel
  Task("You are researcher agent. MUST coordinate via hooks...")
  Task("You are coder agent. MUST coordinate via hooks...")
  Task("You are analyst agent. MUST coordinate via hooks...")
  
  // TodoWrite with ALL todos batched
  TodoWrite { todos: [
    {id: "research", content: "Research API patterns", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
    {id: "design", content: "Design database schema", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
    {id: "implement", content: "Build REST endpoints", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
    {id: "test", content: "Write unit tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"},
    {id: "docs", content: "Create API documentation", status: "pending", priority: "low"}
  ]}
  
  // File operations in parallel
  Bash "mkdir -p app/{src,tests,docs}"
  Write "app/package.json" "..."
  Write "app/README.md" "..."
  Write "app/src/index.js" "..."
```

### 2. Advanced Swarm Topologies

Claude-Flow supports multiple swarm topologies, each optimized for different types of tasks:

#### Hierarchical Topology (Best for Complex Projects)

```javascript
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { 
  topology: "hierarchical", 
  maxAgents: 8, 
  strategy: "specialized" 
}
```

This topology creates a hierarchical structure with a queen coordinator at the top, making it ideal for complex projects with clear leadership and delegation requirements.

#### Mesh Topology (Best for Collaborative Tasks)

```javascript
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { 
  topology: "mesh", 
  maxAgents: 6, 
  strategy: "balanced" 
}
```

This topology creates a fully connected network where all agents can communicate directly with each other, making it ideal for collaborative tasks where information sharing is critical.

#### Adaptive Topology (Best for Dynamic Tasks)

```javascript
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { 
  topology: "adaptive", 
  maxAgents: 10, 
  strategy: "dynamic" 
}
```

This topology automatically adjusts based on the task requirements, making it ideal for dynamic tasks where the coordination needs may change over time.

### 3. Specialized Agent Types

Claude-Flow provides a variety of specialized agent types, each with unique capabilities:

#### Core Development Agents

- **architect**: System design and architecture
- **coder**: Implementation and coding
- **analyst**: Analysis and optimization
- **tester**: Testing and validation
- **coordinator**: Project management and coordination

#### Specialized Domain Agents

- **backend-dev**: Server-side development
- **mobile-dev**: Mobile application development
- **ml-developer**: Machine learning development
- **system-architect**: High-level system design
- **api-docs**: API documentation

#### Analysis & Code Quality Agents

- **code-analyzer**: Code analysis
- **perf-analyzer**: Performance analysis
- **security-analyzer**: Security analysis
- **refactoring-specialist**: Code refactoring

### 4. Memory Persistence

One of the most powerful features of Claude-Flow is persistent memory across sessions:

```javascript
// Store important information
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "store",
  key: "project/architecture",
  value: {
    components: ["auth", "api", "database"],
    decisions: ["Use JWT for auth", "MongoDB for storage"],
    rationale: "Scalability and performance requirements"
  }
}

// Retrieve information later
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "retrieve",
  key: "project/architecture"
}

// List all stored information
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "list",
  pattern: "project/*"
}
```

### 5. Agent Coordination Protocol

When spawning agents using the Task tool, each agent must follow this coordination protocol:

```
You are the [Agent Type] agent in a coordinated swarm.

MANDATORY COORDINATION:
1. START: Run `npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[your task]"`
2. DURING: After EVERY file operation, run `npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "agent/[step]"`
3. MEMORY: Store ALL decisions using `npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notification --message "[decision]"`
4. END: Run `npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]" --analyze-performance true`

Your specific task: [detailed task description]

REMEMBER: Coordinate with other agents by checking memory BEFORE making decisions!
```

### 6. Full-Stack Development Example

Here's a comprehensive example of using Claude-Flow for full-stack development:

```javascript
// Initialize swarm with hierarchical topology
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { 
  topology: "hierarchical", 
  maxAgents: 8, 
  strategy: "specialized" 
}

// Spawn specialized agents
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "architect", name: "System Designer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder", name: "API Developer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder", name: "Auth Expert" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "analyst", name: "DB Designer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester", name: "Test Engineer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coordinator", name: "Lead" }

// Create todos for the project
TodoWrite { todos: [
  { id: "design", content: "Design API architecture", status: "in_progress", priority: "high" },
  { id: "auth", content: "Implement authentication", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "db", content: "Design database schema", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "api", content: "Build REST endpoints", status: "pending", priority: "high" },

  { id: "deploy", content: "Setup deployment pipeline", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
  { id: "monitor", content: "Add monitoring", status: "pending", priority: "medium" }
]}

// Orchestrate the task
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate { 
  task: "Build REST API with authentication", 
  strategy: "parallel" 
}

// Store initial memory
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage { 
  action: "store", 
  key: "project/init", 
  value: { 
    started: Date.now(),
    description: "REST API with authentication",
    requirements: [
      "User authentication with JWT",
      "CRUD operations for users and posts",
      "Role-based access control",
      "API documentation with OpenAPI"
    ]
  } 
}

// Spawn task agents with coordination instructions
Task(`You are the System Designer agent in a coordinated swarm.

MANDATORY COORDINATION:
1. START: Run \`npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Design API architecture"\`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hooks Not Working**: Make sure you're using the new hooks format required by Claude Code 1.0.51+
2. **MCP Server Not Found**: Make sure you've added the MCP server using `claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start`
3. **Memory Not Persisting**: Check that you're using the correct memory keys and actions
4. **Agents Not Coordinating**: Ensure all agents are using the coordination protocol with hooks

### Solutions

1. **Run the Migration Tool**: `claude-flow migrate-hooks` to update your hooks format
2. **Verify MCP Server**: Run `claude mcp list` to check if the MCP server is properly added
3. **Check Memory Storage**: Use `mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage { action: "list", pattern: "*" }` to list all stored memory
4. **Validate Coordination**: Check that all agents are using the pre-task, post-edit, and post-task hooks

## Conclusion
